# pick-game
The project is about rolling the dice, if you click 'roll' button the value from the dice will be added to the current score, but be careful! When you roll 1 you lost all your points from 'current' window! To save them you have to click 'hold' button, and then it's the second player turn! You can roll multiple times until you roll 1 or click 'hold' you win while your score is equal to 100. The project is based at JavaScript course, implemented logic in JS is invented by me, the CSS style is mostly from the course, but I understand this code, and I think I could recreate similar project. The project is deployed on Netlify! Hope you enjoy! Netlify link: https://focused-turing-6a77f8.netlify.app/
